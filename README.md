- ⚡ Fun fact: A fun fact about GitHub is that its mascot is an octocat, a cute hybrid of an octopus and a cat. The octocat was created by GitHub employee Simon Oxley and is now widely recognized as the symbol of the platform. It's often featured in GitHub merchandise, stickers, and promotional materials, adding a playful touch to the developer community.
